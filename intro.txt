My name is Anastasia. I live in Romanov Heights.
I had a wonderful childhood. My sister Maria and I did everything together.
She never got in trouble, but I was mischievous.
My family was very important. We ran the Romanov Heights Homeowners Association.
When people didn't keep their lawns tidy, my father had them sent to Siberian Groves, a trailer park across town.
My older sisters Olga and Tatiana went on walks around the neighborhood to make sure everyone's house was painted one the Approved Imperial Colors.
Our only sorrow was that my baby brother Alexei was very sick, and we often feared he wouldn't survive to adulthood. But then my mother sent for the wise wizard Rasputin.
Rasputin healed Alexei with the power of God, and after that he became, in many ways, a part of the family.
Rasputin was very kind to all of us children; he helped us all remember the importance of having fun.
He's a good man to have in your corner when your back's against a wall.
Now he is my only hope.

Yesterday, the people of Romanov Heights rose up against my family.
Their leader is a man called Lenin, who insists on planting poppies in his garden, even though poppies are not one of the Approved Imperial Flowers.
My parents and all my brothers and sisters have been captured. Lenin's Bolsheviks are scouring the neighborhood for me.
If I am to survive, I have to get to Rasputin's house before they find me. And before my phone's battery dies!
